# Build stage: compile the server and the WASM web app
# Base images are pinned by digest (tag kept for readability). Dependabot's
# `docker` ecosystem (.github/dependabot.yml) bumps the digests; don't hand-edit
# one without re-resolving it. `rust:1-slim-trixie` is the same image as the
# floating `rust:1-slim` at the time of pinning, named explicitly so the Debian
# release visibly matches the runtime stage below.
# NOTE: the digest pins the image, not the compiler — rust-toolchain.toml says
# `channel = "stable"`, so rustup installs whatever stable is current at build
# time once the source is copied in. Pin that file to an exact version (e.g.
# "1.xx.0") for a fully reproducible toolchain.
