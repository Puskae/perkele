//! The WASM app can't talk to GlitchTip directly (the Sentry Rust SDK doesn't
//! support wasm32, and shipping the DSN to browsers is undesirable anyway).
//! Instead the app posts a small report to `POST /api/client-error`, and the
//! server forwards it into its own error pipeline via `tracing::error!`.
